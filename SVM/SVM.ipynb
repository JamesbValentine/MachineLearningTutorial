    "A refinement of the perceptron learning algorithm is the optimal separating hyperplane. The goal is to find a hyperplane which separates the two classes and maximizes the distance from the hyperplane to the closest point from either class. In so doing, this leads to a unique solution to separating hyperplane problem, and tends to lead to better prediction accuracy on new data points.\n",

    "Notice, the requirement that $y_i(x_i'\\beta + \\beta_0) \\geq M$ will ensure that all points are correctly classified and the distance from each point to the separating hyperplane is at least $M$. We can rewrite this in a more familiar way by removing the unit length constraint on $\\beta$ by letting $\\alpha = \\beta ||\\beta||_2$ and $\\alpha_0 = \\beta_0 ||\\beta||_2$, so that the constraint can be written as $y_i(x_i'\\alpha+\\alpha_0)/||\\alpha||_2 \\geq M$, $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. Hence, we see that an equivalent formulation is\n",

    "Support vector machines can be thought of as a generalization of the optimal separating hyperplane. For the proceeding discussion, let us define the space between the two hyperplanes which are determined by the support points as the margin. Based on the original formulation of the optimal separating hyperplane, we can think of the margin as having a width equal to $2\\hat{M}$, where $\\hat{M}$ is the solution to (1).\n",

    "$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_i \\leq \\text{constant}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this is straightforward to interpret â€“ the value of $\\xi_i$ is the proportional amount by which the prediction $x_i'\\beta + \\beta_0$ is on the incorrect side of the margin (relative to the hyperplanes which determine the margin). Misclassifications occur when $\\xi_i > 1$. Thus, a bound on $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_i$ controls the total distance from all misclassified points to the correct side of the margin. Bounding this sum at $L$ bounds the number of training misclassifications at $L$. This is illustrated in Figure 2.\n",
